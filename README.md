## palm-git
_utilities for all those annoying git commands_

Git is great. And git-muscles are fine. But some of us are sick of typing 

`--set-upstream=bla/bla-bla` when it's pretty clear what we want to do. 

Palm-git will be a collection of the many git shortcuts we code in a billion other places
like makefiles, bash aliases etc etc. 

Because why keep doing that when you can just `palm` them?
